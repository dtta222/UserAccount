# UserAccount

# Develop a Java application where you will create a user-defined Java class to maintain data about a user’s credentials to log into an application or system. This will include a user’s name and password and an additional piece of data to help with encryption. We will visit the Caesar cipher again.

# R1: Create the UserAccount class.
# R2: Validate all parameters in UserAccount.
# R3: Encryption and decryption is handled properly.
# R4: Per the UML diagram, accessors are created correctly.
# R5: Per the UML diagram, mutators are created correctly.
# R6: The driver is written to properly test the UserAccount class as defined.
